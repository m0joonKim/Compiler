### Assignment 1: Flex & Bison Exercise

### Assignment 2: F# Exercise

### Prj1 : Phase #1. Type Checking
- You must check the input AST and find type errors
- Our source language will be a simple C-like language (Mini-C)
- We will pose many constraints to our Mini-C languag

### Prj2 : Phase #2. IR Translation
- you will implement AST-to-IR translator

### Prj3 : Phase #3. Optimization
- you will implement IR-level optimization
- I scored 96.4 out of 100. (4th)
- Firstly, 'Translate.fs' may not be in the most optimized state.
- Secondly, The M2R implementation might not be optimized. I'm concerned that my code uses some tricks, which isn't ideal.
- Lastly, My code is written very conservatively with regard to the load operation.

Except for Prj3, I scored 100 on all other projects.
